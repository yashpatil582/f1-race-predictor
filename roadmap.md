# F1 Race Replay Roadmap

Since launching this project, I've receieved a lot of feedback and feature requests from the community. I thought it would be helpful for everyone (including myself) to have a clear vision and roadmap for the future of this project, so if you are planning on contributing or using it, you know what to expect.

## Vision

I want this project to be the hands-down best way for data-loving F1 fans to explore the wide variety of data generated during a race weekend. This means providing a rich, interactive experience that allows users to review races, laps, and sessions in a way that is both informative and engaging. Imagine your very own personal pitwall where you can analyze every detail of the race weekend.

## Primary Goals

- **GUI Menu System:** Implement a user-friendly graphical interface to navigate through the different race weekends, sessions and available formats for reviewing data. ([@IAmTomShaw](https://github.com/IAmTomShaw) is currently working on this)
- **Race Insight Charts:** Develop a suite of interactive charts and visualizations that provide deep insights into how the race or session progressed. Looking at things like track evolution, tyre strategies, pit stops, and driver performance over time, allowing users to understand more about the session.
- **Practice Sessions:** Expand support to include practice sessions (FP1, FP2, FP3). I think this needs a combination of the telemetry analysis that is using for the Qualifying feature, mixed with the track position replay that is used for the race replay. I'm not sure how this is exactly going to work yet, but it's definitely needed. Maybe looking at the different runs that drivers do during practice, and comparing their lap times and tyre usage.

## Performance Enchancements & User Experience Improvements

This project is growing quite quickly, which is fantastic, but is also means that its really easy to overlook performance and user experience optimizations. Some of the key areas I want to focus on include:
- **Reducing Lag during race replay:** Rendering some of the UI elements is starting to cause noticeable lag during race replays, especially on lower-end devices. I want to optimize the rendering process to ensure a smooth experience for all users. (I have already started on this, but there's more work to be done)
- **De-cluttering the UI:** As more features are added, the UI is starting to feel a bit overwhelming. I think it would be great to add better toggle options or preset view types to help usesrs focus on the data that matters most to them. This would also allow us to add more insights on the race replay without being limited by just the available screen space.
 

## Your Contributions

If you would like to get involved with this project and help bring these features to life, please do feel free to reach out or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly valued and will help shape the future of this project.

# Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a smooth collaboration process, please follow these guidelines when contributing to the project:
- **Open Issues:** If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub with a clear description and any relevant details.
- **Choosing what to build**: Feel free to pick any open issue that interests you. If you want to work on a new feature, please discuss it in an issue first or review the roadmap to ensure it aligns with the project's goals.
- **Pull Requests:** When submitting a pull request, please ensure your code only includes changes related to the issue or feature you are addressing. Include a clear description of the changes made and reference the related issue. Also, if your change relates to any visual elements, please include screenshots, GIFs or screen recordings to illustrate the updates.
- **Pull Request Discussions**: Be open to feedback and discussions on your pull requests. Constructive criticism is welcome and helps improve the quality of the project. If you are commenting on someone else's pull request, please be respectful and considerate in your feedback. Always ensure that your feedback is in line with the project's goals and guidelines, rather than personal preferences.


# Project Management

Full transparency, this is my first open-source project where I've accepted contributions from others. Usually I like to work on projects solo and then just release my code when it's done. However, the amount of interest and enthusiasm from the F1 community has been incredible, so I want to make sure that every Developer has the opportunity to help build something great here. I'll do my best to keep this roadmap updated as the project evolves so that everyone is on the same page.
